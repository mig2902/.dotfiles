#### File access from plugins

Plugins can access:
- all files in the directory (`nnn` switches to the dir where the plugin is to be run so the dir is `$PWD` for the plugin)
- the current file under the cursor (the file name is passed as the argument to a plugin)
- the current selection (by reading the file `~/.config/nnn/.selection`, see the plugin `ndiff`)

Each script has a _Description_ section which provides more details on what the script does, if applicable.

#### Contributing plugins

Plugins are scripts and all scripting languages should work. However, POSIX-compliant shell scripts runnable in `sh` are preferred. If that's too rudimentary for your use case, use Python, Perl or Ruby. Please keep non-portable commands (like `notify-send`) commented so users from any other OS/DE aren't surprised.

The plugins should be executable. Please add an entry in the table above.
